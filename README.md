# EVOLVE-ROBOT-
This repository explains the working of a robotic arm( A programmable mechanical device designed to mimic a human armâ€™s movement for tasks like picking, placing, and assembling objects.) and an obstacle avoidance robot( An robot that detects and navigates around obstacles using sensors ), implemented during my internship at Evolve Robots Lab.
 # Robotic Arm: 
- A programmable mechanical device designed to mimic human arm movements for tasks such as picking, placing, and assembling objects.  
- Programmed for precise movement and control  
- Implemented using "Arduino" and "C++"  
- Tested for accuracy and smooth motion execution

# Obstacle Avoidance Mobile Robot
An autonomous mobile robot engineered to detect and navigate around obstacles in real time using ultrasonic sensors and motor driver control.  
- Uses an "ultrasonic sensor" to measure distance to objects  
- If an obstacle is detected within a set range, the robot stops, reverses, and changes direction  
- Controlled by "Arduino Uno" with "C++ programming"
 # Technologies Used : 
- Arduino  
- ROS (Robot Operating System)  
- Python / C++  
- Motor Drivers & Sensor Modules
