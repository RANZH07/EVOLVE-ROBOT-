This repository explains the working of a robotic arm( A programmable mechanical device designed to mimic a human armâ€™s movement for tasks like picking, placing, and assembling objects.) and an obstacle avoidance robot( An robot that detects and navigates around obstacles using sensors ), implemented during my internship at Evolve Robots Lab.
