I successfully designed, programmed, and tested both a robotic arm and an obstacle avoidance mobile robot. The robotic arm demonstrated precise motion control for object manipulation, while the obstacle avoidance robot showcased autonomous navigation using real-time sensor data to detect and bypass obstacles. This internship strengthened my skills in embedded systems, robotics programming, and hardwareâ€“software integration, and provided valuable hands-on experience in building functional robotic systems from concept to execution.
